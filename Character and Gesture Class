Character Movement Class
moveCharacter
{
  if(position y of character is less then figure position y)
	{
	going right
 get the character position and subtrack to it (y pos)
	}
	else
	{
	going left
 get the character position and add to it (y pos)

	}
}



Gesture Class

Tap
{
int counter to keep track of how many taps
long  TAP_TIMEOUT reset taps every r seconds



if(user taps on screen)
{
	start tap timeout
	if tap is timeout   break
	if count ==1 then single tap
	if count >= 2 then double tap
}

if rotate
{
get distance of both figures and save it as the old position
get angle by comparing the old position of figures to new ones
rotate object by the angle

}

if pinch
{
get the distance between both fingers 
set the pinch to that distance 
scale object from the distance given
}



Touch Point Class
float x postion
float y position
float px, old x
float py, old y
 float angle , current angle
  float oldAngle , old angle
  float pinch  , current pinch
  float oldPinch, old pinch

TouchPoint(float x, float y, int id) 
{
set all points
}
 
void update(float x, float y) 
{
update points 
px = x
py = y
we keep the old points to make comparisons 
x=x
y=y
}

  void setAngle(float angle) 
{
updating the angle
oldAngle = angle
angle = angle
}
  void setPinch(float pinch) 
{
updating the pinch
oldPinch = pinch
pinch = pinch

}
